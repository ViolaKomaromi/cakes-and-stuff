yesterday and today im trying to do main2, with separate grids, its not going well, i did the first main1, but the main2 is just owerflowing with the first one.... i need help, i dont understand the problem.... 
my questions:is it even posible? or schould i made the grid-templete (column and row) attributes in one main div and then place the other div children according to the main div?
maybe i'll figure it ot, my brain is a mesh.... i need a pause.... and flexbox, is hell, tis grid is much more logical. 

ps: i didnt want to style the main2 as i did the main 1, just wanted to add picures under the pink stuff....
